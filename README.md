Python code to extract words and in turn extract letters using pytesseract

This is a very simple code for beginners where basic image processing properties are used like dilation and masking to segment words, from which text is in turn extracted. For extreme beginners, a few tips has been given below.

Please change the directories of your images in your pc accordingly for variable 'img'.
This code works perfectly on jupyter notebook and has not been tested on python terminal.
Change directories while saving images for variables 'mask' and 'mask_dilation'.
A sample image has been provided for better understanding of code.
A FOR loop can be put on this to run on multiple images.
